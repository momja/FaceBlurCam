# FaceBlurCam IOS App

FaceBlurCam is a free, open-source IOS camera application that automatically blurs any human faces it detects in photos, protecting people from facial recognition software and preserving their privacy. The camera saves both the original image and the blurred version to the camera roll.

## Overview

This app makes use of two open source projects, one from apple, and one from a developer I found on Github:

1) Customizing an Image Picker Controller, a project on the Apple developer page, found here: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimagepickercontroller/customizing_an_image_picker_controller
2) BlurFace, found here: https://github.com/dcordero/BlurFace

I used these two with code of my own to create this project.
